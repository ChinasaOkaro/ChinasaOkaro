- 👋 Hi, I’m Chinasa Okaro.
- 👀 I’m interested in using data to answer questions, solve problems and ultimately help businesses make data-driven improvements, especially in the healthcare industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the Google Data Analytics Course in order to hone my data analysis skills (e.g. problem-solving, communication, etc.) and improve my knowledge of data analysis tools (e.e. SQL, Spreadsheets, Visualization tools, etc.).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects and volunteer my time and knowledge in different data analysis endeavours. I also hope to get a paid employment where I can help managers solve business problems.
- 📫 I'm most active on LinkedIn and so you can reach me there, here's my profile URL: http://linkedin.com/in/chinasa-okaro-87618bb2
